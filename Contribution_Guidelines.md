# Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute, just send a Pull Request.  Please:
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one to prevent duplicates. 
* Put the tool in the alphabetical order. All tools are great, so we want to treat them equally.
* Try to make your Pull Request descriptive.
* New categories are welcomed.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period and remove trailing whitespace.
* Check your (and our ) spelling and grammar.

## Link Format
Please, use the following format for the links in Pull Requests:
* ``[Tool](link) â€” description``.
* Add the appropriate label:

## Review Workflow  
We will do our best to review your submission as soon as we can. Please, consider that we have a full-time job in our startup :) Your contribution might be rejected if the tool didn't pass our curation. Of course, this is very subjective and if you think we are being unfair, do let us know.
